A Flask application for OSU's 2021 Hackathon (24 hrs).

Our challenge was to make a web application for Veeva Systems.
Our project files are attached.
Front end is HTML5 with inline CSS and javascript.
Backend is Flask with python (pandas and plotly express for data manipulation and visualization, respectively).



Okay, I admit that this project is not mobile responsive; I simply ran out of time and was ignorant of faster ways of styling. I'm updating that now and will
update this project with better styling soon.
Here's the project: https://aegoff25.pythonanywhere.com/
